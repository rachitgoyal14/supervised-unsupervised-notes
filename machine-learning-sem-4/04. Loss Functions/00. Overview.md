Loss functions are the heart of machine learning optimization—they quantify how wrong our predictions are and guide the learning process. This section explores different loss functions (MSE, MAE), explains why we square errors, and covers the critical assumptions underlying linear regression. Understanding loss functions is essential for choosing the right metric for your problem and debugging model performance.

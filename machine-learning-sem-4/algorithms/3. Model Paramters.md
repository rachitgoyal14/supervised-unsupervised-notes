Model parameters are basically the outputs we derive from a model

m, c in case of regression

beeta_1, beeta_2 (sometimes also called)



there are two ways of deriving model parameters from this:


1. closed form


OLS -> ordinary list square


direct formula

small data, lesser number of dimensions (1 dimensional data)

drawback of this particular approach:

what if we have 1000 features (basically larger number of dimensions)

2. open form
gradient descent
list some initial data abut this



there are 4 steps to gradient descent:
1. randomly assign values to m and c (beeta_1 and beeta_0)
2. calculate the partial derivative of m and c with respect to loss (error)
3. calculate new beeta_0 and beeta_1
the first three stages are called 1st iteration
4. repeat steps - 1, 2, 3

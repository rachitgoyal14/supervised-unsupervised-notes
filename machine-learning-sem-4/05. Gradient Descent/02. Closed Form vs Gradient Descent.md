## Overview

To find optimal coefficients (β₀, β₁, ..., βₙ) in linear regression, we have two main approaches:

1. **Closed Form Solution** (Analytical)
2. **Gradient Descent** (Iterative)

---

## Closed Form Solution (Normal Equation)

### Definition

**Closed form** means we can calculate the exact solution using a **direct formula** without iteration.

Also called:
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**
- **Normal Equation**
- **Analytical Solution**

---

### Mathematical Formula

For simple linear regression (1 variable):

$$m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

$$c = \bar{y} - m\bar{x}$$

For multiple linear regression (matrix form):

$$\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$$

Where:
- **β** = vector of coefficients (including intercept)
- **X** = design matrix (input features)
- **y** = target vector
- **$X^T$** = transpose of X
- **$(X^TX)^{-1}$** = inverse of $X^TX$

---

### Time Complexity

**Computing matrix inverse:** $O(n^3)$

Where n = number of features

**Problem:** For large datasets with many features, this becomes computationally expensive!

**Example:**
- 10 features → $10^3 = 1,000$ operations
- 1,000 features → $1,000^3 = 1,000,000,000$ operations (1 billion!)

---

### Advantages

✅ **Exact solution** (no approximation)
✅ **One-step computation** (no iteration)
✅ **No hyperparameters** to tune (no learning rate)
✅ **Works well for small datasets** (< 10,000 features)

---

### Disadvantages

❌ **$O(n^3)$ time complexity** (very slow for many features)
❌ **Requires matrix inversion** (computationally expensive)
❌ **Needs entire dataset in memory**
❌ **Fails if $X^TX$ is singular** (non-invertible)
❌ **Doesn't scale to large datasets**

---

### When to Use Closed Form

Use when:
- Dataset is **small** (< 10,000 samples)
- Number of features is **small** (< 1,000)
- You need the **exact solution**
- Matrix $X^TX$ is **invertible**

---

## Gradient Descent (Non-Closed Form)

### Definition

**Gradient descent** is an **iterative optimization algorithm** that finds the minimum by taking steps proportional to the negative of the gradient.

**Key idea:** Start with random parameters, then repeatedly adjust them to reduce error.

---

### Algorithm Steps
```
1. Initialize parameters randomly: β = [random values]
2. Repeat until convergence:
   a. Calculate predictions: ŷ = Xβ
   b. Calculate error/loss: J(β) = MSE
   c. Calculate gradient: ∇J = partial derivatives
   d. Update parameters: β = β - α∇J
3. Return optimized β
```

---

### Mathematical Formulas

**Cost Function (MSE):**

$$J(\beta) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\beta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$

**Gradient:**

$$\nabla J(\beta) = \frac{1}{m}X^T(X\beta - y)$$

**Update Rule:**

$$\beta_{new} = \beta_{old} - \alpha \nabla J(\beta_{old})$$

Where:
- **α** (alpha) = learning rate (step size)
- **m** = number of training examples
- **∇J** = gradient vector

---

### Time Complexity

**Per iteration:** $O(m \cdot n)$

Where:
- m = number of samples
- n = number of features

**Total:** $O(k \cdot m \cdot n)$

Where k = number of iterations

**Key advantage:** Linear in features (much better than $O(n^3)$!)

---

### Advantages

✅ **Scales to large datasets** (millions of samples)
✅ **Works with many features** (millions of features)
✅ **Memory efficient** (can use mini-batches)
✅ **Always works** (no matrix inversion needed)
✅ **Can be parallelized**
✅ **Works for non-linear models** too

---

### Disadvantages

❌ **Requires tuning learning rate** (α)
❌ **May converge slowly**
❌ **Can get stuck in local minima** (for non-convex functions)
❌ **Requires multiple iterations**
❌ **Approximate solution** (not exact)

---

### When to Use Gradient Descent

Use when:
- Dataset is **large** (> 10,000 samples)
- Number of features is **large** (> 1,000)
- $X^TX$ is **non-invertible**
- Need **memory efficiency**
- Working with **online learning** (streaming data)

## Matrix Inversion Problem

### Why is Inversion $O(n^3)$?

Matrix inversion typically uses:
- **Gaussian elimination**
- **LU decomposition**
- **Cholesky decomposition**

All have $O(n^3)$ complexity for $n \times n$ matrix.

### Example: Computational Cost

| Features (n) | Operations ($n^3$) | Time (approx) |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 10 | 1,000 | < 1 ms |
| 100 | 1,000,000 | ~10 ms |
| 1,000 | 1,000,000,000 | ~10 seconds |
| 10,000 | $10^{12}$ | ~3 hours |
| 100,000 | $10^{15}$ | Impractical |

**Conclusion:** Closed form becomes impractical beyond ~10,000 features.

## Python Implementation

### Closed Form (Normal Equation)
```python
import numpy as np

def closed_form_solution(X, y):
    """
    Solve linear regression using Normal Equation
    β = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y
    """
    # Add bias column (intercept)
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X]
    
    # Normal equation
    beta = np.linalg.inv(X_b.T @ X_b) @ X_b.T @ y
    
    return beta

# Example
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])

beta = closed_form_solution(X, y)
print(f"Coefficients: {beta}")
```

---

### Gradient Descent
```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    """
    Solve linear regression using Gradient Descent
    """
    # Add bias column
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X]
    
    # Initialize parameters randomly
    beta = np.random.randn(X_b.shape[1])
    
    m = len(y)
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Predictions
        y_pred = X_b @ beta
        
        # Calculate gradient
        gradient = (1/m) * X_b.T @ (y_pred - y)
        
        # Update parameters
        beta = beta - learning_rate * gradient
        
        # Optional: print cost every 100 iterations
        if i % 100 == 0:
            cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum((y_pred - y)**2)
            print(f"Iteration {i}: Cost = {cost:.4f}")
    
    return beta

# Example
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])

beta = gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000)
print(f"Coefficients: {beta}")
```

## 📖 From Class Notes

### Why Gradient Descent Over Normal Equation?

From the class notes: Imagine you have a dataset with 100,000 different features (like age, location, income, etc., for a house price model). To use the direct math formula, you first have to create a "summary table" (the X'X matrix) that compares every feature against every other feature. The problem is: It's Too Big. A 100,000 by 100,000 table has 10 billion cells. Even if you use a standard amount of computer memory for each number, that single table would take up 80GB of RAM. Most home laptops only have 8GB or 16GB of RAM.

To overcome this, we use gradient descent because it doesn't need to create that massive 80GB table. It looks at small batches of data at a time. It never tries to solve the whole puzzle in one giant leap; it just takes small steps toward the right answer.

### Gradient Descent Applications from Lecture

**In Machine Learning:**
1. **Linear Regression**: GD minimizes MSE to fit a line/plane for continuous predictions
2. **Logistic Regression**: GD minimizes Log Loss for binary classification (spam detection)
3. **SVM**: GD minimizes Hinge Loss to find maximum margin between classes

**In Deep Learning:**
1. **Neural Networks**: Backpropagation applies Chain Rule with GD to update millions/billions of weights
2. **CNNs**: GD optimizes filters for edge detection in image recognition
3. **Transformers**: GD variants (like Adam) train models with trillions of parameters

### The Mountain Analogy

Suppose you are lost in the mountains in a dense fog, and you can only feel the slope of the ground below your feet. A good strategy to get to the bottom of the valley quickly is to go downhill in the direction of the steepest slope.

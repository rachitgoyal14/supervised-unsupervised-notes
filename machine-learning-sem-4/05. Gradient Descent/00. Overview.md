Gradient descent is the optimization algorithm that powers most machine learning. This section covers how gradient descent iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize loss, compares the three variants (batch, stochastic, and mini-batch), and explains when to use closed-form solutions versus iterative optimization. Understanding gradient descent is essential for mastering both classical algorithms and deep learning.

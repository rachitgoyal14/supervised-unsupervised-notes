This section covers the fundamentals of linear regression—the foundation of predictive modeling. You'll learn what makes a "best fit" line, how to evaluate regression models using various metrics, and the mathematical derivation behind ordinary least squares. Linear regression is both interpretable and efficient, making it the starting point for understanding more complex models.

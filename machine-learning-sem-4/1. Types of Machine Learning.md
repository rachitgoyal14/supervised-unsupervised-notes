## Ways to Categorize Machine Learning

There are multiple ways to categorize machine learning approaches:

    ML --> CAT2[2. Type of Deployment]
    ML --> CAT3[3. How Learning Works]

    style CAT2 fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
    style CAT3 fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
```

## Category 1: Amount of Supervision Required

Machine learning algorithms can be categorized based on the **level of supervision** they need during training:

```mermaid
graph TB
    SUP[Amount of Supervision] --> SL[Supervised Learning]
    SUP --> UL[Unsupervised Learning]
    SUP --> SSL[Semi-Supervised Learning]
    SUP --> SELF[Self-Supervised Learning]
    SUP --> RL[Reinforcement Learning]
    
    SL --> SL_DESC["Learning with a teacher<br/>Labeled data provided"]
    UL --> UL_DESC["Self-discovery learning<br/>Find patterns yourself"]
    SSL --> SSL_DESC["Mixed approach<br/>Few labels + lots of data"]
    SELF --> SELF_DESC["Create your own homework<br/>Generate labels from data"]
    RL --> RL_DESC["Trial and error<br/>Learn from rewards/penalties"]
    
    style SUP fill:#9C27B0,color:#fff
    style SL fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style UL fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
    style SSL fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
    style SELF fill:#00BCD4,color:#fff
    style RL fill:#F44336,color:#fff
```

### 1. [[2. Supervised Machine Learning|Supervised Machine Learning]]

**Analogy:** *Like learning math with an answer key - you see the problem AND the solution.*

- **Data:** Input features + Output labels
- **Goal:** Learn the mapping from inputs to outputs
- **Types:** [[2. Supervised Machine Learning#Regression|Regression]], [[2. Supervised Machine Learning#Classification|Classification]]

**Example Dataset:**
| IQ  | CGPA | Placement |
| --- | ---- | --------- |
| 85  | 8.9  | Yes       |
| 90  | 8.0  | Yes       |
| 75  | 6.0  | No        |

---

### 2. [[3. Unsupervised Machine Learning|Unsupervised Machine Learning]]

**Analogy:** *Like organizing your closet without labels - you group similar items (colors, types) naturally.*

- **Data:** Only input features (no labels)
- **Goal:** Discover hidden patterns or structure

**Types:** Visualization, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, Association Rules

**Examples:**
- Customer segmentation (clustering)
- Fraud detection (anomaly detection)
- "Customers who bought X also bought Y" (association rules)

---

### 3. [[4. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning|Semi-Supervised Machine Learning]]

**Analogy:** *Like learning from a few textbook examples, then practicing with unlabeled problems.*

- **Data:** Small amount of labeled + Large amount of unlabeled
- **Use Case:** Labeling data is expensive/time-consuming
- **Example:** You have 100 labeled medical images but 10,000 unlabeled ones

---

### 4. [[5. Self-Supervised Machine Learning|Self-Supervised Learning]]

**Analogy:** *Like learning a language by predicting the next word in a sentence - you create your own exercises from raw text.*

- **Data:** Unlabeled data that creates its own labels
- **Examples:** 
  - Predict next word in sentence
  - Predict masked portions of images
  - Predict image rotation angle

---

### 5. [[6. Reinforcement Learning|Reinforcement Learning]]

**Analogy:** *Like training a dog - reward good behavior (sit = treat), penalize bad behavior (bark = no treat).*

- **Components:** Agent, Environment, Actions, Rewards/Penalties
- **Goal:** Maximize cumulative reward
- **Examples:** Game AI, robotics, self-driving cars

## Category 2: Type of Deployment / Incremental Learning

Machine learning systems can be categorized based on **how they handle new data** during and after deployment:

```mermaid
graph TB
    DEPLOY[Type of Deployment] --> BATCH[Batch Learning]
    DEPLOY --> ONLINE[Online Learning]
    DEPLOY --> OUTCORE[Out-of-Core Learning]
    
    BATCH --> BATCH_DESC["Train offline on complete data<br/>Periodic retraining"]
    ONLINE --> ONLINE_DESC["Learn continuously on server<br/>Real-time adaptation"]
    OUTCORE --> OUTCORE_DESC["Train on data chunks<br/>Then continue online"]
    
    style DEPLOY fill:#9C27B0,color:#fff
    style BATCH fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style ONLINE fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
    style OUTCORE fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
```

### 1. [[Machine Learning Deployment Types#1. Batch Learning (Offline Learning)|Batch Learning]]

- **Training:** Offline with complete dataset
- **Updates:** Periodic retraining required
- **Use Case:** Data changes slowly (house prices, annual forecasts)

### 2. [[Machine Learning Deployment Types#2. Online Learning (Incremental Learning)|Online Learning]]

- **Training:** Continuous on deployment server
- **Updates:** Real-time, automatic
- **Use Case:** Dynamic data (stock trading, social media feeds)

### 3. [[Machine Learning Deployment Types#3. Out-of-Core Learning|Out-of-Core Learning]]

- **Training:** Data divided into chunks
- **Updates:** After chunks, switches to online learning
- **Use Case:** Datasets too large for memory (big data applications)

## Category 3: How the Model Learns

Machine learning can be categorized based on **how predictions are made**:

```mermaid
graph TB
    HOW[How Learning Works] --> INST[Instance-Based Learning]
    HOW --> MODEL[Model-Based Learning]
    
    INST --> INST_DESC["Memorize training data<br/>Predict by similarity"]
    MODEL --> MODEL_DESC["Learn general pattern<br/>Predict by applying rules"]
    
    style HOW fill:#9C27B0,color:#fff
    style INST fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
    style MODEL fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
```

### 1. [[Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning#1. Instance-Based Learning|Instance-Based Learning]]

- **Approach:** Memorize all training examples
- **Prediction:** Find similar examples and use their outputs
- **Deployment:** Requires all training data at deployment
- **Examples:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means

### 2. [[Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning#2. Model-Based Learning|Model-Based Learning]]

- **Approach:** Learn generalized pattern or formula
- **Prediction:** Apply learned pattern to new data
- **Deployment:** Only model needed, not training data
- **Examples:** Linear Regression, SVM, Neural Networks

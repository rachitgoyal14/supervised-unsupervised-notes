Evaluating classification models requires more than just accuracy. This section teaches you to read confusion matrices, understand precision vs recall trade-offs, use F1 score for balanced evaluation, and distinguish between loss and cost functions. These skills are essential for building models that perform well in real-world scenarios, especially with imbalanced datasets where accuracy can be misleading.

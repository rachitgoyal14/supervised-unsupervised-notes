The Sigmoid Function:

here logistic / sigmoid function comes in action. The logistic / sigmoid function is used because the output is between 0 and 1, giving the idea of a probability

write the sigmoid function formula

$$sigma (z) = 1 / 1(1 + e^-z)$$



#### decision rule in classification


After computing: y = sigma (z)


we classify as class 1 if p >= 0.5
class 0 if p < 0.5

Logistic regression is a supervised classification algorithm.
Although the name stays regression, it is a classification algorithm.
It measures relationship between one or more independent variables (X) and the categorical dependent variable (Y) by estimating probabiliies using a logistic (sigmoid) function.
The term 'Regression' comes because it estimates the probability of class membership.



Now there are a few examples where logistic regression is used.
email spam classification (bla bla bla)

why don't we use regression for classification issues?

regression deals with continous data and classification deals with discrete values

nature of problem statement

linear regression predicts a value y
if we train it on clas data, it might output y = 0.7
we can interpret this as a probability but linear regression doesn't know its daeling with classes
it tries to fit a line to minimize error, not separate classes

the outlier problem (large errors get penalized heavily)

range of regression line( the range of regression line is minus infinity to + infiinity but we need it to be 0 to 1)

linear regression can predict (-2, 1.8, 5.3) which are invalid probabilities

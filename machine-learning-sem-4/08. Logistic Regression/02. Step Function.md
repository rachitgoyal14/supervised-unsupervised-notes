how to solve the problem?

1. perceptron model 
the perceptron trick is the geometric way of undersating how the decision boundary moves when a point is misclassificed

for 2 features:
draw a scatter plot here with a single dependent and a single independent variable




INSTRUCTIONS TO CLAUDE: ONLY EXPLAIN THIS BRIEFLY SINCE THIS IS FOR UNDERSTANDING PURPOSE ONLY

the equation for logistic regression is


Ax + By + C = 0


y = w_0 + w_1*x1 + w2*x2 = 0 

i can rewrite this as 

y = w0 * x^0 + w_1*x1 + w2*x2 = 0 

coefficients: w_0, w_1, w_2

in the perceptron trick we randomly asign these values and then we calculate Y = sigma i to N w_i * x_i

if w_i * x_i > 0, we assign 1 to that value, that means the student is going to be placed

wi * x_i <= 0, we assign the value 0, that means the student is not getting placed

CONS:
the perceptron uses a step function and updates weights only when a point is misclassificed

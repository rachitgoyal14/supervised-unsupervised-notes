Logistic regression is a fundamental **classification** algorithm that estimates the probability of class membership. Despite its name, it predicts discrete classes (0 or 1) rather than continuous values. It works by applying a sigmoid function to a linear combination of features, producing outputs between 0 and 1 that can be interpreted as probabilities. This folder covers the core concepts from step functions to optimization techniques, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation details.

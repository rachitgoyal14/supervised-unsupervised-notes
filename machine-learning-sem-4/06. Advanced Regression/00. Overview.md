This section extends simple linear regression to handle more complex scenarios. You'll learn multiple linear regression (using multiple features to make predictions) and polynomial regression (capturing non-linear relationships by adding squared and cubic terms). These techniques dramatically expand the range of problems you can solve with linear models while maintaining interpretability.

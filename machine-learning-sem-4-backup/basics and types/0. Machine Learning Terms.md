## Overfitting

**Definition:** Model memorizes data, performs well on training data but poorly on test data.

**Analogy:** Like a student who memorizes exam questions and answers without understanding concepts. They ace practice tests but fail when questions are slightly different on the real exam.

---

## Underfitting

**Definition:** Model is too simple, performs poorly on training data.

**Analogy:** Like using a straight ruler to trace a curvy mountain path. The tool is too simple to capture the complexity of the terrain.

---

## Dimensionality

**Definition:** Number of features in the data.

**Analogy:** Think of describing a house. Each feature (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, age) is a dimension. More dimensions mean more ways to describe the house.

---

## Anomaly

**Definition:** Rare or unusual data point.

**Analogy:** Like finding a penguin in a desert. It's extremely rare and doesn't fit the normal pattern of what you'd expect to see there.

---

## Novelty

**Definition:** New unseen pattern not present during training.

**Analogy:** Like a chef who learned to cook Italian and French cuisine, then encounters Thai food for the first time. It's a completely new pattern they haven't experienced before.

---

## Data Pipeline

**Definition:** Flow of data from source to model.

**Analogy:** Like a factory assembly line where raw materials enter, go through processing stations, and emerge as finished products.

---

## Upstream

**Definition:** Data source or earlier stages in the pipeline.

**Analogy:** Like the beginning of a river where water originates from mountains and springs before flowing downstream.

---

## Downstream

**Definition:** Model output or later stages in the pipeline.

**Analogy:** Like the mouth of a river where all the water eventually flows out into the ocean.

---

## Model Parameter

**Definition:** Values learned by the model during training.

**Analogy:** Like a musician's muscle memory developed through practice. The musician doesn't consciously decide these movements—they're learned automatically through repetition.

---

## Hyperparameter

**Definition:** Settings configured by humans before training.

**Analogy:** Like adjusting the temperature and time on an oven before baking. The chef sets these knobs, but the actual baking (learning) happens inside based on these settings.

## Core Concept

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting parameters in the direction of steepest descent.

### Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)

```
J(m, c) = (1/n) Σ(yi - (mxi + c))²
```

Where:

- `m` = slope/weight
- `c` = intercept/bias
- `n` = number of data points
- `yi` = actual value
- `mxi + c` = predicted value

### Parameter Update Rule

```
m = m - α * ∂J/∂m
c = c - α * ∂J/∂c
```

Where `α` is the learning rate.

### Partial Derivatives

```
∂J/∂m = -(2/n) Σ xi(yi - (mxi + c))
∂J/∂c = -(2/n) Σ (yi - (mxi + c))
```

## 1. Batch Gradient Descent

Uses the **entire dataset** in each iteration to compute gradients.

### Algorithm

```
For each iteration:
    1. Calculate predictions for ALL n samples: ŷi = mxi + c
    2. Compute cost: J = (1/n) Σ(yi - ŷi)²
    3. Calculate gradients using ALL samples:
       ∂J/∂m = -(2/n) Σ xi(yi - ŷi)
       ∂J/∂c = -(2/n) Σ (yi - ŷi)
    4. Update parameters:
       m = m - α * ∂J/∂m
       c = c - α * ∂J/∂c
```

### Convergence Path

```mermaid

    A[Start Position] -->|Smooth path| B[Iteration 1]
    B -->|Direct descent| C[Iteration 2]
    C -->|Steady progress| D[Global Minimum]
    style D fill:#90EE90
```

### Advantages

1. **Stable convergence** - moves directly toward minimum with smooth trajectory
2. **Exact gradient** - uses complete information from entire dataset
3. **Finds true minimum** - for convex problems, guarantees global minimum
4. **Predictable behavior** - consistent step directions

### Disadvantages

1. **Slow for large datasets** - must process all samples before single update
2. **Memory intensive** - requires loading entire dataset into memory
3. **Computationally expensive** - O(n) operations per iteration
4. **Not suitable for online learning** - cannot update with streaming data

### Best For

- Small datasets (n < 10,000)
- Low number of features
- When precision is critical
- Convex optimization problems

## 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Uses **one random sample** per iteration to compute gradients.

### Algorithm

```
For each iteration:
    1. Randomly select ONE sample (xi, yi)
    2. Calculate prediction: ŷi = mxi + c
    3. Compute gradients using ONLY this sample:
       ∂J/∂m = -2 * xi(yi - ŷi)
       ∂J/∂c = -2 * (yi - ŷi)
    4. Update parameters:
       m = m - α * ∂J/∂m
       c = c - α * ∂J/∂c
```

### Student Analogy

**Batch GD**: Teacher addresses all 500 students' doubts in all 10 topics, then updates teaching approach once.

**SGD**: Teacher picks one random student, addresses their doubt in one topic, updates approach immediately. Repeats with different random students.

### Convergence Path

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] -->|Noisy step| B[Position 1]
    B -->|Oscillation| C[Position 2]
    C -->|Fluctuation| D[Position 3]
    D -->|Noisy path| E[Near Minimum]
    E -->|Continues oscillating| E
    style E fill:#FFD700
```

### Advantages

1. **Fast updates** - parameter update after each sample
2. **Low memory** - processes one sample at a time
3. **Computationally efficient** - O(1) per iteration
4. **Can escape local minima** - noise helps jump out of shallow minima
5. **Online learning** - can update with streaming data
6. **Works with large datasets** - doesn't need all data in memory

### Disadvantages

1. **Noisy convergence** - erratic path with high variance
2. **Oscillations around minimum** - never settles exactly at minimum
3. **Less precise** - gradient estimate based on single sample
4. **Requires learning rate decay** - need to reduce α over time
5. **Unstable** - can overshoot or diverge with poor learning rate

## 3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Uses **small batches of samples** per iteration to compute gradients.

### Algorithm

```
For each iteration:
    1. Randomly select a BATCH of b samples (typically 32, 64, 128, 256)
    2. Calculate predictions for batch: ŷi = mxi + c
    3. Compute gradients using batch:
       ∂J/∂m = -(2/b) Σ(batch) xi(yi - ŷi)
       ∂J/∂c = -(2/b) Σ(batch) (yi - ŷi)
    4. Update parameters:
       m = m - α * ∂J/∂m
       c = c - α * ∂J/∂c
```

### Student Analogy

Teacher groups 500 students into batches of 50. Addresses one batch's doubts, updates teaching approach, then moves to next batch.

### Convergence Path

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] -->|Moderate noise| B[Iteration 1]
    B -->|Controlled path| C[Iteration 2]
    C -->|Steady descent| D[Iteration 3]
    D -->|Converges well| E[Minimum]
    style E fill:#87CEEB
```

### Advantages

1. **Balanced speed** - faster than batch, more stable than SGD
2. **Reduced variance** - smoother than SGD, better gradient estimate
3. **Vectorization** - efficient matrix operations on GPU/CPU
4. **Memory efficient** - doesn't need entire dataset in memory
5. **Good convergence** - combines benefits of both batch and SGD
6. **Parallelizable** - batch operations leverage hardware acceleration

### Disadvantages

1. **Hyperparameter tuning** - need to choose batch size
2. **Still has some noise** - more than batch GD
3. **May need learning rate scheduling** - for best results

### Common Batch Sizes

- 32: small datasets, faster iterations
- 64: good default choice
- 128: balanced performance
- 256: large datasets, smoother gradients

## Common Issues and Concepts

### 1. Oscillations

Occur when learning rate is too high or using SGD.

```
Cost function oscillates around minimum instead of smoothly converging
```

**Causes**:

- Learning rate too large
- High variance in SGD
- Non-convex landscape

**Solutions**:

- Reduce learning rate
- Use learning rate decay
- Switch to mini-batch
- Add momentum

### 2. Saddle Points

Points where gradient is zero but not a minimum.

```
∂J/∂m = 0 and ∂J/∂c = 0, but not at minimum
```

**Characteristics**:

- Gradient vanishes
- Algorithm gets stuck
- Common in high-dimensional spaces

**Solutions**:

- Use momentum-based methods
- Add noise (SGD helps escape)
- Use adaptive learning rates (Adam, RMSprop)

### 3. Local vs Global Minima

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Cost Surface] --> B[Local Minimum]
    A --> C[Global Minimum]
    B -.->|Stuck here| B
    C -.->|Want to reach| C
    style C fill:#90EE90
    style B fill:#FFB6C6
```

**For Linear Regression**: Cost function is convex, only one global minimum exists.

**For Non-linear Models**: Multiple local minima possible, SGD noise helps exploration.

### 4. Learning Rate Impact

```
α too small: slow convergence, many iterations needed
α optimal: fast and stable convergence
α too large: divergence, overshooting minimum
```

**Typical values**: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1

### 5. Convergence Criteria

Stop when:

```
|J(iteration_t) - J(iteration_t-1)| < ε
```

Where ε is a small threshold (e.g., 0.0001)

## Practical Implementation Tips

### Batch Gradient Descent

```python
# Pseudocode
for epoch in range(max_iterations):
    predictions = m * X + c
    dm = -(2/n) * sum(X * (y - predictions))
    dc = -(2/n) * sum(y - predictions)
    m = m - learning_rate * dm
    c = c - learning_rate * dc
```

### Stochastic Gradient Descent

```python
# Pseudocode
for epoch in range(max_epochs):
    for i in random_order(n):
        prediction = m * X[i] + c
        dm = -2 * X[i] * (y[i] - prediction)
        dc = -2 * (y[i] - prediction)
        m = m - learning_rate * dm
        c = c - learning_rate * dc
```

### Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

```python
# Pseudocode
batch_size = 64
for epoch in range(max_epochs):
    for batch in create_batches(X, y, batch_size):
        predictions = m * batch_X + c
        dm = -(2/batch_size) * sum(batch_X * (batch_y - predictions))
        dc = -(2/batch_size) * sum(batch_y - predictions)
        m = m - learning_rate * dm
        c = c - learning_rate * dc
```

## Summary

**Use Batch GD when**: Small dataset, need precision, have memory/time

**Use SGD when**: Large dataset, online learning, want speed, can tolerate noise

**Use Mini-Batch GD when**: Most practical applications (default choice)

The choice depends on dataset size, computational resources, and precision requirements.
